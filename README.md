# Drunk-and-Drive-Engine-locking-system-8051-Microcontroller
                  In this project we have developed a prototype model that can automatically lock the engine when a drunken driver tries to drive a car. Now-adays car accidents are mostly seen. By fitting this alcohol sensor into the car, we can save guard the life of the driver and also the remaining passengers. It is very simple application.                     The life time of the project is high. It has low or zero maintenance cost and of course low power consumption. This is a developed design to efficiently check drunken driving. By implementing this design a safe car journey is possible decreasing the accident rate due to drinking.                     By implementing this design, drunken drivers can be controlled so are the accidents due to drunken driving. Government must enforce laws to install such circuit in every car and must regulate all car companies to preinstall such mechanisms while manufacturing the car itself.                     If this is achieved the deaths due to drunken drivers can be brought to minimum level. In this type of system, future scope can be safely landing of car aside without disturbing other vehicles.
